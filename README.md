# DeepLearning_interpet_Signlanguage
The goal for this paper is to build a neural network able to classify which letter of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet is being signed, given an image of a signing hand. Building this makes possible sign language translator which can take communications in sign language and translate them in written and oral language.
